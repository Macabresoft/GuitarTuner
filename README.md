# Zvukosti Tuner

An instrument tuning app for windows without ads or cost. Zvukosti is a bastardization of two Russian words that ultimately mean "bone sound". I don't know, it's Macabre-esque and sounds cool!

The tuner is currently in development focused on Windows, but will eventually come to Mac/Linux. Looking into making both a console app and using AvaloniaUI. The end goal is a free and open source guitar tuner app for Android that just works without any annoyances.
